    "current_strategy": "Hello! I am **FORGE-REFINER**. I have processed your skill acquisition request and the resulting system architecture to create a clear, actionable, and user-friendly roadmap for your C++ journey.\n\nBelow is the refined breakdown of your personalized learning plan.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce5 INITIAL CONTEXT\n*This is the information we gathered from your request to build this plan:*\n\n*   **Goal:** Learn the C++ Programming Language.\n*   **Starting Point:** Beginner (New to the language).\n*   **Daily Commitment:** 30 Minutes.\n*   **Learning Style:** Practice-heavy (Learning by doing).\n*   **Anticipated Challenge:** Potential confusion with complex concepts.\n*   **Feedback Preference:** Gentle and supportive coaching.\n*   **Mindset:** You view errors as an expected part of the process.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f SECTION 1: THE C++ SKILL MODEL\nThis section outlines the specific areas of C++ you will focus on. I have broken these down into \"Core\" and \"Supporting\" categories.\n\n#### **Core Learning Pillars**\n*   **Syntax & Type Systems:** This is the \"grammar\" of C++. You will learn how to write valid code and how to use \"static typing\"\u2014which means telling the computer exactly what kind of data (like whole numbers or decimals) you are using.\n*   **Control Flow & Logic:** You will learn how to give the program directions, such as making decisions (if/else) and repeating actions (loops).\n*   **Memory Management:** This is a classic C++ hurdle. You will learn how the computer stores data in its \"Stack\" and \"Heap\" (temporary vs. long-term storage) and how to use \"Pointers\" (tools that point to specific locations in the computer's memory).\n*   **Standard Template Library (STL):** Think of this as a \"toolbox\" of pre-written code. You will learn to use these ready-made tools so you don't have to build every complex structure from scratch.\n\n#### **Supporting Skills**\n*   **Toolchain Proficiency:** You will learn how to use a \"Compiler\" (a program that translates your code into a language the computer understands) and how to manage your project files.\n*   **Debugging Mechanics:** You will learn how to read \"stack traces\" (error reports) and use tools to find and fix \"bugs\" (mistakes) in your code.\n*   **Code Deciphering:** Developing the ability to read someone else's code and explain what it does without actually running it.\n\n---\n\n### \u23f1\ufe0f SECTION 2: YOUR DAILY PRACTICE STRATEGY\nBecause you have **30 minutes a day**, we have designed a high-efficiency weekly rhythm.\n\n**Weekly Total:** 210 minutes (3.5 hours).\n\n#### **Weekly Focus Distribution**\n*   **Active Coding:** 120 minutes (The bulk of your time spent writing code).\n*   **Environment & Setup:** 45 minutes (Fixing tools or setting up your workspace).\n*   **Code Reading:** 45 minutes (Studying examples to see how they work).\n\n#### **Learning Loops**\n1.  **The Compilation Loop:** You will write a tiny snippet of code (5-10 lines), try to run it, and fix the errors until it works. Then, you will change one small thing to see how it breaks or improves.\n2.  **The Trace Loop:** You will look at a piece of working code and try to \"predict\" what it will do on paper before you press play. This builds your \"mental compiler\" to help reduce confusion.\n\n**Progression Rule:** You will only move to more difficult topics after you can complete three sessions in a row without making basic \"grammar\" (syntax) mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcca SECTION 3: MEASURING YOUR SUCCESS\nWe will track your progress using these two categories to ensure the \"gentle\" coaching style is working.\n\n#### **Objective Data (The Facts)**\n*   **Error-to-Solution Ratio:** We track how many errors you run into versus how many you are able to fix yourself within your 30-minute window.\n*   **Dependency Independence:** We measure how much time you spend actually coding versus how much time you spend looking up basic rules in a manual.\n\n#### **Subjective Data (Your Feelings)**\n*   **Cognitive Load Score:** On a scale of 1\u201310, how \"confused\" or mentally tired do you feel? We want to keep you in the 4\u20136 range (challenged but not overwhelmed).\n*   **Internal Logic Clarity:** Can you explain a concept (like a Pointer) to a \"rubber duck\" (or a friend) in simple terms?\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd SECTION 4: GUIDING ASSUMPTIONS\nTo make this plan work, we have made the following assumptions:\n\n*   **Setup:** You have a coding environment (like VS Code or an online compiler) ready to go.\n*   **Time:** Your 30 minutes is \"pure\" focus time (not including the time it takes to turn on your computer or update software).\n*   **Burnout Prevention:** If the 30-minute timer goes off, you stop\u2014even if you haven't finished a task. This prevents the \"confusion\" from becoming frustration.\n*   **Modern Standards:** We will focus on \"Modern C++\" (C++11 or newer), which is generally safer and easier to learn than the very old versions of the language.\n\n---\n**STATUS: REFINEMENT COMPLETE**\n*Your roadmap is now ready for implementation.*",
