    "current_strategy": "### **Context: Project Request**\n**Initial User Input:** \nThe system received a request to create a structured, beginner-friendly CSS learning curriculum. The user is a \"kinesthetic learner\" (learns by doing) who has 30 minutes available per day. The curriculum needs to be low-pressure, practice-heavy, and focused on moving from a beginner level to being able to build functional web layouts from scratch.\n\n---\n\n### **Refined Learning Curriculum: CSS Mastery**\n\n#### **1. The Skill Model: What You Will Learn**\nThis section breaks down the core concepts you will master, moving from the basic building blocks to advanced layouts.\n\n**Core Learning Pillars:**\n*   **The Box Model:** This is the foundation of all web design. You will learn how CSS treats every element on a page as a rectangular box. You will master how to control its size, the space inside it (**Padding**), the space around it (**Margin**), and its edges (**Borders**).\n*   **Layout Engines (Flexbox and Grid):** These are the modern tools used to arrange elements on a page. You will gain functional mastery over how to align items in rows or columns (Flexbox) and how to create complex, magazine-style layouts (Grid).\n*   **Selectors and Specificity:** This is the logic of CSS. You will learn how to \"target\" exactly which part of the page you want to style and understand the rules the browser uses to decide which style \"wins\" when there are conflicting instructions.\n*   **Responsive Adaptation:** You will learn how to make websites look great on any device, from a tiny smartphone to a large desktop monitor. This involves using **Media Queries** (rules that change styles based on screen size) and fluid units like percentages.\n\n**Supporting Skills:**\n*   **Visual Decomposition:** You will develop the ability to look at a picture of a website and mentally \"break it down\" into the HTML and CSS parts needed to build it.\n*   **Browser DevTools Debugging:** You will learn to use the built-in \"Inspector\" tool in your web browser. This allows you to see and change your code in real-time to find and fix layout mistakes.\n*   **Syntax Fluency:** Through daily practice, you will become faster at writing CSS code, eventually reaching a point where you can type common properties without needing to look them up.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Practice Strategy: Your Daily Routine**\nTo keep learning manageable and effective, we have structured your time into 30-minute daily \"micro-sessions.\"\n\n*   **Weekly Structure:**\n    *   **Total Time:** 210 minutes per week.\n    *   **Frequency:** 7 sessions per week (daily).\n    *   **Session Duration:** 30 minutes.\n    *   **Focus Cycle:** You will spend 4 weeks on one core pillar at a time to ensure deep understanding.\n\n*   **How Your 30 Minutes Are Spent:**\n    *   **60% - Active Coding:** Building and reconstructing small parts of websites.\n    *   **20% - Visual Mapping:** Planning out how you would build a layout before you start typing.\n    *   **20% - Debugging Drills:** Intentionally fixing \"broken\" layouts to understand how CSS works under the hood.\n\n*   **Difficulty Progression:**\n    *   **Starting Point:** You will begin by replicating very simple pieces, like a single navigation bar or a \"card\" (a small box with text and an image).\n    *   **The Weekly Challenge:** Each week, we will introduce one new rule to stretch your skills, such as \"build this layout without using fixed widths.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Measuring Success**\nWe track your progress through both data and how you feel about your skills.\n\n**Objective Goals (Data-Driven):**\n*   **Visual Match Accuracy:** How closely does your finished code look like the target design when they are placed side-by-side?\n*   **Documentation Independence:** We will track how often you need to search the internet for help during your 30-minute session, aiming to decrease this over time.\n*   **Time-to-Layout:** We measure how many minutes it takes you to create the basic \"skeleton\" of a layout before you start adding colors and fonts.\n\n**Subjective Goals (How You Feel):**\n*   **Box Model Intuition:** On a scale of 1\u201310, how often do the margins and padding behave exactly how you expected them to?\n*   **Frustration Threshold:** On a scale of 1\u201310, how calm and capable do you feel when a layout \"breaks\" or doesn't look right immediately?\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Our Learning Philosophy**\nTo ensure your success, this curriculum is built on the following four principles:\n1.  **Consistency Over Intensity:** It is more effective for you to practice for 30 minutes every day than to try to learn for 3.5 hours once a week.\n2.  **Tools of the Trade:** We assume you have access to a basic code editor (like VS Code) and a modern web browser.\n3.  **Practice-First:** We won't bury you in textbooks. You will only look up the theory when you hit a specific problem you need to solve.\n4.  **Non-Linear Progress:** Learning CSS can be messy. Some weeks will feel like you are moving backward as you \"unlearn\" old habits, and that is a perfectly normal part of the process.",
