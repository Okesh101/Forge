You will focus on generics and mapped types to ensure your codebase remains DRY while maintaining high levels of safety across your entire application architecture. Developing this skill set will transform how you view your code, shifting your perspective from merely fixing errors to proactively designing systems where your types act as a living documentation and a guardrail for your future development efforts within larger and more complex projects.",
