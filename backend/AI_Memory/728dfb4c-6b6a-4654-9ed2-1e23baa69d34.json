    "current_strategy": "Hello! I am **FORGE-REFINER**. I have processed the internal system specifications for your ROS2 learning journey. Below is a refined, frontend-ready breakdown of your practice plan, designed for clarity and ease of use.\n\n***\n\n### \ud83d\udce5 Context Foundation\n**Initial User Goal:** Transition from a beginner to a functional level in **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)**\u2014 the industry-standard software framework for building robots.\n**Focus:** Practical, hands-on application over dry theory.\n**Schedule:** 10\u201315 minute daily \"micro-learning\" sessions to build a consistent habit without causing burnout.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0 The Core Skill Model\n*This section defines the specific technical areas you will master.*\n\n#### **1. Communication Patterns**\nYou will learn how different parts of a robot talk to each other using three main methods:\n*   **Topics (Pub/Sub):** Like a radio broadcast where one part \"publishes\" info and others \"subscribe\" to listen.\n*   **Services (Req/Res):** A one-on-one conversation where one part asks a question and gets a specific answer.\n*   **Actions:** Used for long tasks (like moving a robot arm) where you need updates on progress and the ability to cancel.\n\n#### **2. Node Management**\nIn ROS2, a **Node** is a small, independent program responsible for one task (e.g., controlling a wheel). You will learn to write, configure, and manage these programs.\n\n#### **3. Workspace Orchestration**\nYou will learn to manage your \"Workshop.\" This involves:\n*   **Packages:** Organizing your code.\n*   **Colcon:** The tool used to \"build\" or compile your code so it\u2019s ready to run.\n*   **Launch Files:** Scripts that start multiple nodes at once with a single command.\n\n#### **4. Environment & Diagnostics**\n*   **Linux Dexterity:** Getting comfortable using the **Terminal (CLI)**\u2014the text-based interface used to talk to the computer.\n*   **Diagnostic Tools:** Learning how to use ROS2\u2019s built-in \"health check\" commands to see if your robot is running correctly or why it has stopped.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc5 Your Daily Practice Plan\n**Phase 1 Duration:** 4 Weeks | **Daily Commitment:** 15 Minutes\n\n| Days | Focus | Activity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Mon \u2013 Wed** | **Core Drills** | Practice writing simple communication nodes from scratch. |\n| **Thu \u2013 Fri** | **CLI Speed Runs** | Practice using terminal commands quickly to fix \"broken\" workspaces. |\n| **Saturday** | **Integration** | Take two separate things you built earlier in the week and make them work together. |\n| **Sunday** | **Review** | Check your progress and decide if next week should be harder or easier. |\n\n**The Goal:** We focus 60% of your time on the \"mechanics\" of coding and 30% on navigating the software environment, leaving only 10% for theory.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc8 Tracking Your Progress\n*We use these metrics to see how you are improving without adding stress.*\n\n*   **Time to Build:** How many seconds does it take from opening your laptop to successfully building your code?\n*   **Error Resolution:** Can you fix a \"syntax error\" (a typo in the code) or a ROS error on your own within your 15-minute window?\n*   **Interface Recall:** Can you remember the commands to start your robot without looking at a \"cheat sheet\"?\n*   **Confusion Latency:** When something goes wrong, how quickly do you feel you can get back on track? (Goal: 1 = Fast recovery, 5 = Stuck).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Setup & Assumptions\nTo ensure your 15-minute sessions are productive, we have designed this plan with the following assumptions:\n\n1.  **The Environment:** You have **Ubuntu Linux** or a **Docker Container** (a pre-packaged software environment) already set up. This prevents \"installation frustration\" from eating up your practice time.\n2.  **The Language:** We will use **Python**. It is easier to read and faster to write than C++, making it perfect for 15-minute sessions.\n3.  **The Method:** We use **\"Kata\" (Repetitive Exercises)**. Since 15 minutes is too short for a massive project, you will practice small, repeatable tasks until they become \"muscle memory.\"\n4.  **Graceful Pausing:** If life gets in the way, you can stop at any time. The plan is designed so you can pick up exactly where you left off without penalty.",
