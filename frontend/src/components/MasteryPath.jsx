            <div className="intro-section">
              <p>
                You're about to start something different. This isn't a static
                course—it's a thinking system that learns from your progress and
                adapts in real time.
              </p>
            </div>

            Time Optimization 
            <div className="strategy-card">
              <h3>⏱️ Time Adaptation</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Your commitment:</strong>{" "}
                <span className="user-data">[timeCommitment]</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                The system will start with bite-sized sessions that fit your
                schedule, then autonomously adjust duration and frequency as it
                detects your actual engagement patterns.
              </p>
            </div>

            Learning Style 
            <div className="strategy-card">
              <h3>🧠 Learning Method Alignment</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Your style:</strong>{" "}
                <span className="user-data">[learningStyle]</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                All exercises and feedback will be structured around this
                approach. When the system notices stagnation, it will experiment
                with complementary methods and report what works.
              </p>
            </div>

            Challenge Mitigation 
            <div className="strategy-card">
              <h3>🛡️ Proactive Roadblock Handling</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Your challenge:</strong>{" "}
                <span className="user-data">[challenge]</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                The agent will monitor for early signs of this pattern and
                intervene before it derails you. Each intervention will be
                logged and refined based on effectiveness.
              </p>
            </div>

            Failure Response 
            <div className="strategy-card">
              <h3>🔄 Failure Recovery Protocol</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Your typical response:</strong>{" "}
                <span className="user-data">[failureResponse]</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                When setbacks occur, the system won't just notice—it will
                analyze why, adjust the difficulty curve, and provide
                context-aware recovery steps.
              </p>
            </div>

            Coaching Style 
            <div className="strategy-card">
              <h3>🗣️ Communication Style</h3>

                <span className="user-data">[coachingStyle]</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                All nudges, feedback, and strategy updates will be delivered in
                this tone. The system will track which communication patterns
                lead to better engagement.
              </p>
